In this project, I will build a dynamic dashboard using JavaScript, as well as Plotly and D3 libraries. The charts rendered are a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart.
changing the subject(patient) id will update the charts.

#Note: the project must be hosted on a server to render properly.
